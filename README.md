# OOP Assignment: Classes, Inheritance & Polymorphism

## Overview

This project demonstrates key concepts of *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python*, including:

- *Classes and Objects*
- **Constructors (__init__)**
- *Encapsulation (private attributes)*
- *Inheritance*
- *Polymorphism*

It consists of two parts:

1. *Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class*

   - A Superhero class with attributes, methods, and encapsulated health.
   - A subclass FlyingHero demonstrating inheritance and additional functionality.
   - Demonstrates object creation, method usage, and private attribute access via getter methods.

2. *Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge*
   - A Vehicle base class with a move() method.
   - Subclasses Car, Plane, and Boat implement move() differently.
   - Demonstrates *polymorphism*: same method behaves differently for each subclass.
